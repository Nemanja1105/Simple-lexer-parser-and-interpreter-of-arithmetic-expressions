# Simple-lexer-parser-and-interpreter-of-arithmetic-expressions

This project represents the implementation of a lexer, parser, and interpreter for arithmetic expressions with support for integers. The project supports the following functionalities:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integer division.
Printing the value of expressions and variable values using the "print" command, which takes an expression or variable name as an argument.
Proper interpretation of negative numbers in expressions.
Grouping of arithmetic expressions using parentheses.
Assignment of values to variables and using variables within expressions.
The project enables the construction of a parsing tree.
